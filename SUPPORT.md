## Questions

For usage questions:

  - OS + Python/Docker versions
  - command(s) used
  - HTTP requests/responses (no secrets)
  - logs (ideally including `x-correlation-id`)

If your problem looks like a bug, please use the “Bug report” template.

## Feature requests

Features are prioritized based on real-client compatibility (Terraform/SDK/CLI).

- Describe the target client (e.g. Terraform `microsoft/azuredevops` provider)
- Provide HTTP traces and/or required endpoints if possible
- List the payload fields the client actually consumes
