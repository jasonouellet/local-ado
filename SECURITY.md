# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This project moves quickly. In practice:

- The `main` branch is considered the supported version.
- Older tagged releases may not receive security fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for security reports.

Preferred:

1. Use GitHub’s **“Report a vulnerability”** (Security Advisories) feature, if enabled for the repository.

Alternative (if needed):

- Contact the maintainers through a private channel agreed within your organization (or add a comment within the GitHub Security Advisory).

In your report, please include:

- Description and impact (what is possible / what is not)
- Reproduction steps
- Affected version/commit
- Relevant logs/snippets (no secrets)

## Response timeline

Targets (best effort):

- Acknowledgement: within 7 days
- Initial assessment: within 14 days

These timelines are not guaranteed (community-maintained project).

## Responsible disclosure

Please allow time for a fix to be prepared before any public disclosure.

## Important notes

- This service is intended as a local mock and should not be exposed to the public Internet as-is.
- Do not commit secrets in versioned fixtures.
