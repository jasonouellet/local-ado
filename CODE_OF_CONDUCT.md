# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

We want a welcoming, constructive, and respectful community.

We are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, background, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, nationality, religion, or level of experience.

## Expected behavior

- Be respectful and kind in language and tone.
- Accept constructive feedback and stay factual.
- Seek to understand before jumping to conclusions.
- Be mindful of others’ time and energy (keep issues/PRs concise and actionable).

## Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, intimidation, insults, personal attacks.
- Discriminatory, sexist, racist, or demeaning language.
- Sharing private information without consent (doxxing).
- Deliberate trolling, spamming, or sabotage.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- interactions in this repository (issues, PRs, reviews, discussions)
- project-related interactions in public spaces where someone represents the project

## Enforcement

Maintainers may:

- ask for a behavior to stop
- moderate or remove content
- lock conversations
- close or refuse contributions
- temporarily or permanently ban accounts in case of repeated or severe abuse

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- contact the maintainers through a private channel (or a GitHub Security Advisory if relevant)
- include as much context as possible (links, screenshots, dates), without escalating the conflict publicly

## Thank you

Thanks for helping keep this project a great place to collaborate.
